# CaughtCam
Caught on Camera iOS app, using PHP to scrape the current list from the Drupal website of Nottingham Police.

## Current state
Currently, this app got rejected from the App Store, and is currently in development (read: abandoned until further notice).

This repo serves as a home for the code for the PHP scraper, aswell as the App.

This is currently what the output from the scraper looks like:

	<dict>
		<key>name</key>
		<string>Mansfield: Shop Theft</string>
		<key>image</key>
		<string>http://www.nottinghamshire.police.uk/sites/default/files/styles/police_appeals_thumbnail/public/CoC%2C%20Shop%20Theft%2C%20Mansfield.jpg?itok=8h49dEkG</string>
		<key>link</key>
		<string>f=</string>
		<key>date</key>
		<string>Not supplied</string>
		<key>article</key>
		<string><![CDATA[Recognise this man? &nbsp;]]></string>
	</dict>

## Next steps
I hope to submit this to the AppStore later this year with working code, with the idea of adding future police forces into the system.
